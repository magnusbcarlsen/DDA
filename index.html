                <p><i>This is what debate aims create: an ability to critically process information without hidden biases.</i></p>

            <h1>About Danish Debate Association
            </h1>
            <p>Danish Debate Association (DDA) is a non-profit organisation which aims to create and facilitate a strong and sustainable debating culture in Denmark. The organisation works towards this aim through a variety of concepts, such as its flagship event, the Nordic Schools Debating Championship (NSDC), and its wide-reaching outreach programme.</p>
            <p>The organisation was founded by three former members of the Danish national debate team, all of whom competed at the World Schools Debating Championships. Since then, the organisation has attracted some of the top talent within the debating circuit, who are all dedicated to the mission of giving students the opportunity to debate. With their hard work and dedication, the organisation has hosted more than 20 nations, and welcomed keynote speakers such as Anders Fogh Rasmussen, former Secretary General of NATO, and Mogens Lykketoft, former President of the United Nations General Assembly. </p>
            <p>At DDA, we believe that educating the public in debate creates a culture of critical thinking: debate helps us analyse the logical links in arguments, understand the power of rhetoric, and broaden our cultural and intellectual horizons. It is with all this in mind that the organisation was founded.</p>

                        <h2>What type of work do we do?</h2>
                        <p>In order to achieve our aim of spreading debate throughout Denmark, we do a lot of different types of work: from organising debating tournaments, designing and testing an ambitious outreach programme, to finding new organisations to partner with.</p>
                        <p>To organise the work, we have two teams: Partnerships & Outreach and Events. Here’s a brief rundown of what they do: </p>
                        <p>The Events team organises our events, such as tournaments and workshops. The aim of the Events team is broadly speaking to ensure that there are ways for debaters to compete against each other, whether that be against domestic or international teams. </p>
                        <p>One of these events is the annual Nordic Schools Debating Championship (NSDC), an international tournament in Copenhagen. At NSDC 2018, we had more than 300 participants from 17 countries, and the tournament is now one of the largest in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Partnerships & Outreach (PaO) team is charged with the responsibility of creating and maintaining an interest in debate amongst students. To that end, the team has developed an outreach programme that is intended to help high schools set up and run debating societies.
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover, PaO also works on creating partnerships with relevant organisations and entities to further organisation-wide goals. </p>
                        <p>New volunteers will most likely be assigned to one of the two teams. Regardless of which team a volunteer joins, they will most likely also be working with the other team. This makes sense: in order to fulfill our overall goal, the two teams interact, coordinate, and share and develop ideas.</p>
                        <h2>What are the benefits to volunteering?
                        </h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Impact. Becoming part of DDA means that you will have the opportunity to have a positive impact on high school students. Currently, many don’t know of competitive debating, and you can help give them the opportunity to become more confident and analytical speakers and individuals.</li><br>
                            <li>Real-world skills. There are plenty of opportunities to improve your skill set: whether it be getting familiar with useful tech systems, honing your communication skills or learning how an organisation works.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>Community. When you join DDA, you join a community of 15+ volunteers. You can look forward to taking part in social and intellectual events just for volunteers.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2>What does it take to be a volunteer?</h2>
                        <p>In order to volunteer, you will need:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To be able to work 3 to 5 hours weekly, and</li>
                            <li>To be passionate and committed to the DDA mission
                            </li>
                            <p>… that’s it! Although it is preferable to have debate experience, it is not a requirement: much of our work does not directly require any prior knowledge of debating.</p>
                            <p>Sound interesting? Send us an email with your resumé and 200 words as to why you want to join DDA, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

                <p>Annika first became interested in debate in her English class in high school. There, she discovered how small rhetorical devices can create strong arguments with subtle nuances.
